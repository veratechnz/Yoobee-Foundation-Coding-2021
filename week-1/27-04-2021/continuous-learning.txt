Continued From Today's Class - Javascript - Variables
Today we looked at variables and basic ways of updating an html UI (DOM) with variables.
Please check the code samples channel to see images regarding variables. The last image is the most simple form of a variable:
var myName = 'Jared';
Task A: Examine the code template below and:
Make a new div with Name: blank // Movie: blank // Food: blank
Create 3 new variables that update and change the content (blank changes to real info)
Task B: 3 Student Divs with 9 variables & a click Event:
Make 3 divs that represent 3 different students (Same as above x3)
Create 9 variables to update all info types (Name: blank // Movie: blank // Food: blank x3)
Have a click event (either on a button or a window) that updates the info in the HTML/DOM
Task C: Using setTimeout() to incrementally update the DOM/HTML
Use 1 or more set timeout's to update the student content one at a time after 2 seconds
I will post all answers as code files below this post :writing_hand:  (edited)
